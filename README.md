# Python Vioce Assistant

You can use the vioce assistant project I made according to your wishes.

## Description

I made a simple voice assistant project with Python. You can speak with the sentences written in the dictionary.py file.
The assistant will respond to the sentence you tell him.
You can customize it by adding the sentences you want in English to the dictionary.py file. The exit command is sufficient to stop the assistant.
